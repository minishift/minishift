[[setup-virtualization-environment-overview]]
== Overview

Follow the appropriate procedure to set up the hypervisor for your particular operating system.
{project} uses link:https://github.com/docker/machine/tree/master/libmachine[libmachine] and its driver plug-in architecture to provide a consistent way to manage the {project} VM.

Some hypervisors require manual installation of the driver plug-in.
{project} embeds the VirtualBox driver plug-in, so no additional steps are required to configure it.
However, VirtualBox will need to be identified to {project} via the `--vm-driver virtualbox` flag or persistant configuration settings.
See xref:setting-up-virtualbox-driver[Setting Up {project} to Use VirtualBox] for more information.

See the appropriate section for your hypervisor and operating system:

[[setting-up-xhyve-driver]]
=== Setting Up the xhyve Driver

{project} is currently tested against `docker-machine-driver-xhyve` version 0.3.3.

[[xhyve-homebrew-install]]
==== Homebrew Install

Use the following command to install the latest version of the driver with Homebrew:

----
$ brew install docker-machine-driver-xhyve
----

Once installed, enable root access for the `docker-machine-driver-xhyve` binary and add it to the default *wheel* group:

----
$ sudo chown root:wheel $(brew --prefix)/opt/docker-machine-driver-xhyve/bin/docker-machine-driver-xhyve
----

Set the owner User ID (SUID) for the binary as follows:

----
$ sudo chmod u+s $(brew --prefix)/opt/docker-machine-driver-xhyve/bin/docker-machine-driver-xhyve
----

You can verify the existing version of the xhyve driver on your system using `brew info` as follows:

----
$ brew info --installed docker-machine-driver-xhyve
docker-machine-driver-xhyve: stable 0.3.3 (bottled), HEAD

  Poured from bottle on 2017-08-18 at 14:46:20
From: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/docker-machine-driver-xhyve.rb
----

For more information, see the GitHub documentation for the link:https://github.com/zchee/docker-machine-driver-xhyve#install[xhyve driver].

[[xhyve-manual-install]]
==== Manual Install

To manually install the xhyve driver, you need to download and install the `docker-machine-driver-xhyve` binary and place it in a directory which is on your `PATH` environment variable.
The directory *_/usr/local/bin_* is recommended, as it is the default installation directory for Docker Machine binaries.

The following steps explain the installation of the `docker-machine-driver-xhyve` binary to the *_/usr/local/bin/_* directory:

. Download the `docker-machine-driver-xhyve` binary using:
+
----
$ sudo curl -L  https://github.com/zchee/docker-machine-driver-xhyve/releases/download/v0.3.3/docker-machine-driver-xhyve -o /usr/local/bin/docker-machine-driver-xhyve

[[setting-up-hyper-v-driver]]
=== Setting Up the Hyper-V Driver
To use {project} with Hyper-V:

. Install link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/enable-hyper-v[Hyper-V].

. Add the user to the local Hyper-V Administrators group.
+
[NOTE]
====
This is required to allow the user to create and delete virtual machines with the Hyper-V Management API.
For more information, see xref:../troubleshooting/troubleshooting-driver-plugins.adoc#insufficient-privileges[Hyper-V commands must be run as an Administrator].
====

. Add an link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/connect-to-network[External Virtual Switch].

. Verify that you pair the virtual switch with a network card (wired or wireless) that is connected to the network.

. Use the configuration option `hyperv-virtual-switch` or startup flag `--hyperv-virtual-switch` to set the name of the external virtual switch you want to use for {project}.
+
For example, on PowerShell use
+
----
PS> minishift config set hyperv-virtual-switch "External (Wireless)"
----
or
+
----
PS> minishift start --hyperv-virtual-switch "External (Wireless)"
----
+
[NOTE]
====
- The name of the virtual switch is case sensitive.
- The use of the environment variable `HYPERV_VIRTUAL_SWITCH` has been deprecated. Instead `MINISHIFT_HYPERV_VIRTUAL_SWITCH` can be used as a configuration option, although this is not recommended as environment variables on Windows do not support non-ASCII characters.

{next-steps}

[[setting-up-virtualbox-driver]]
== Setting Up {project} to Use VirtualBox

VirtualBox must be manually installed in order to use the embedded VirtualBox drivers.
VirtualBox version 5.1.12 or later is required.
Ensure that you link:https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads[download and install VirtualBox] before using the embedded drivers.

VirtualBox must be identified to {project} through either the `--vm-driver virtualbox` flag or persistant configuration options.

[[use-virtualbox-temporarily]]
=== Use VirtualBox Temporarily

The `--vm-driver virtualbox` flag will need to be given on the command line each time the `minishift start` command is run.
For example:

----
$ minishift start --vm-driver virtualbox
----

[[use-virtualbox-permanently]]
=== Use VirtualBox Permanently

Setting the `vm-driver` option as a persistent configuration option allows you to run `minishift start` without explicitly passing the `--vm-driver virtualbox` flag each time.
You may set the `vm-driver` persistent configuration option as follows:

----
$ minishift config set vm-driver virtualbox
----

[NOTE]
====
The `vm-driver` persistent configuration option must be supplied before `minishift start` has been run.
If you have already run `minishift start`, ensure that you run `minishift delete`, set the configuration with `minishift config set vm-driver virtualbox`, then run `minishift start` in order to make use of the VirtualBox driver.
