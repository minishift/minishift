[[setup-virtualization-environment-overview]]
== Overview

Follow the appropriate procedure to set up the hypervisor for your particular operating system.
{project} uses link:https://github.com/docker/machine/tree/master/libmachine[libmachine] and its driver plug-in architecture to provide a consistent way to manage the {project} VM.

Some hypervisors require manual installation of the driver plug-in.
{project} embeds the VirtualBox driver plug-in, so no additional steps are required to configure it.
However, VirtualBox will need to be identified to {project} via the `--vm-driver virtualbox` flag or persistant configuration settings.
See xref:setting-up-virtualbox-driver[Setting Up {project} to Use VirtualBox] for more information.

See the appropriate section for your hypervisor and operating system:

- For xref:for-linux[Linux], xref:setting-up-kvm-driver[set up the KVM driver]
- For xref:for-macos[macOS], xref:setting-up-hyperkit-driver[set up the hyperkit driver]
- For xref:for-windows[Windows], xref:setting-up-hyper-v-driver[set up the Hyper-V driver]
- For VirtualBox, xref:setting-up-virtualbox-driver[set up {project} to use VirtualBox]

[[setting-up-kvm-driver]]
=== Setting Up the KVM Driver

{project} is currently tested against `docker-machine-driver-kvm` version 0.10.0.

Proceed to the instructions for your Linux distribution after you have set up the `docker-machine-driver-kvm` binary.

For more information, see the GitHub documentation of the link:https://github.com/dhiltgen/docker-machine-kvm#quick-start-instructions[Docker Machine KVM driver].

+
----
$ sudo virsh net-start default
----

. Now mark the *default* network as autostart:
+
----
$ sudo virsh net-autostart default

[[setting-up-hyperkit-driver]]
=== Setting Up the hyperkit Driver

{project} is currently tested against *docker-machine-driver-hyperkit* version 1.0.0.

Using hyperkit requires having both `hyperkit` and `docker-machine-driver-hyperkit` installed

==== Installing hyperkit

The following steps explain the installation of the *hyperkit* binary to the *_/usr/local/bin/_* directory:

. Download the *hyperkit* binary using:
+
----
$ sudo curl -L https://github.com/code-ready/machine-driver-hyperkit/releases/download/v0.15.0/hyperkit -o /usr/local/bin/hyperkit
----

. Enable root access for the *hyperkit* binary and add it to the default *wheel* group:
+
----
$ sudo chown root:wheel /usr/local/bin/hyperkit
----

. Set owner User ID (SUID) for the binary as follows:
+
----
$ sudo chmod u+s,+x /usr/local/bin/hyperkit
----

==== Installing docker-machine-driver-hyperkit

* If you use link:https://brew.sh[Homebrew] you can install the latest version of `docker-machine-driver-hyperkit`:

----
$ brew install docker-machine-driver-hyperkit
----

* Alternatively, you can download and install the *docker-machine-driver-hyperkit* binary and place it in a directory which is on your `PATH` environment variable. The directory *_/usr/local/bin_* is a good choice, since it is the default installation directory for Docker Machine binaries.

The following steps explain the installation of the *docker-machine-driver-hyperkit* binary to the *_/usr/local/bin/_* directory:

. Download the *docker-machine-driver-hyperkit* binary using:
+
----
$ sudo curl -L  https://github.com/machine-drivers/docker-machine-driver-hyperkit/releases/download/v1.0.0/docker-machine-driver-hyperkit -o /usr/local/bin/docker-machine-driver-hyperkit
----

. Enable root access for the *docker-machine-driver-hyperkit* binary and add it to the default *wheel* group:
+
----
$ sudo chown root:wheel /usr/local/bin/docker-machine-driver-hyperkit
----

. Set owner User ID (SUID) for the binary as follows:
+
----
$ sudo chmod u+s,+x /usr/local/bin/docker-machine-driver-hyperkit
----

[NOTE]
====
The downloaded *docker-machine-driver-hyperkit* binary is compiled against a specific version of macOS.
It is possible that the driver will fail to work after a macOS version upgrade.
In this case you can try to compile the driver from source:

----
$ go get -u -d github.com/machine-drivers/docker-machine-driver-hyperkit
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/machine-drivers/docker-machine-driver-hyperkit

# Install docker-machine-driver-hyperkit binary into /usr/local/bin
$ make build
----

For more information, see the link:https://github.com/machine-drivers/docker-machine-driver-hyperkit/blob/master/README.md[hyperkit driver] documentation on GitHub.

[[for-windows]]
== Windows

[[setting-up-hyper-v-driver]]
=== Setting Up the Hyper-V Driver
To use {project} with Hyper-V:

. Install link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/enable-hyper-v[Hyper-V].

. Add the user to the local Hyper-V Administrators group.
+
[NOTE]
====
This is required to allow the user to create and delete virtual machines with the Hyper-V Management API.
For more information, see xref:../troubleshooting/troubleshooting-driver-plugins.adoc#insufficient-privileges[Hyper-V commands must be run as an Administrator].
====

. Add an link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/connect-to-network[External Virtual Switch].

. Verify that you pair the virtual switch with a network card (wired or wireless) that is connected to the network.

. Use the configuration option `hyperv-virtual-switch` or startup flag `--hyperv-virtual-switch` to set the name of the external virtual switch you want to use for {project}.
+
For example, on PowerShell use
+
----
PS> minishift config set hyperv-virtual-switch "External (Wireless)"
----
or
+
----
PS> minishift start --hyperv-virtual-switch "External (Wireless)"
----
+
[NOTE]
====
- The name of the virtual switch is case sensitive.
- The use of the environment variable `HYPERV_VIRTUAL_SWITCH` has been deprecated. Instead `MINISHIFT_HYPERV_VIRTUAL_SWITCH` can be used as a configuration option, although this is not recommended as environment variables on Windows do not support non-ASCII characters.

==== Next Steps

{next-steps}

[[setting-up-virtualbox-driver]]
== Setting Up {project} to Use VirtualBox

VirtualBox must be manually installed in order to use the embedded VirtualBox drivers.
VirtualBox version 5.1.12 or later is required.
Ensure that you link:https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads[download and install VirtualBox] before using the embedded drivers.

VirtualBox must be identified to {project} through either the `--vm-driver virtualbox` flag or persistant configuration options.

[[use-virtualbox-temporarily]]
=== Use VirtualBox Temporarily

The `--vm-driver virtualbox` flag will need to be given on the command line each time the `minishift start` command is run.
For example:

----
$ minishift start --vm-driver virtualbox
----

[[use-virtualbox-permanently]]
=== Use VirtualBox Permanently

Setting the `vm-driver` option as a persistent configuration option allows you to run `minishift start` without explicitly passing the `--vm-driver virtualbox` flag each time.
You may set the `vm-driver` persistent configuration option as follows:

----
$ minishift config set vm-driver virtualbox
----

[NOTE]
====
The `vm-driver` persistent configuration option must be supplied before `minishift start` has been run.
If you have already run `minishift start`, ensure that you run `minishift delete`, set the configuration with `minishift config set vm-driver virtualbox`, then run `minishift start` in order to make use of the VirtualBox driver.
